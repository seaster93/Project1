  <p>Hey Everyone!</p>
  <p>My name is Sydney Easter and I am a first year graduate student here at IIT.</p>
  <p>If you're wondering what I am doing in this class, I am currently taking a bunch of prerequisites for IT.</p>
  <p>My undergraduate degree is in Economics so transferring into the ITM major is a whole new world for me.</P>
  <p>I am from Washington State, but am happy to be here and enjoy some warmer weather.</p>
